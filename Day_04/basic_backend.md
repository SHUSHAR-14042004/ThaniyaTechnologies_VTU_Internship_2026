Through studying the fundamentals of backend development, I developed a theoretical understanding of how server-side applications are built using Express.js on top of Node.js. I learned about RESTful architecture, routing, middleware functions, request-response cycles, and handling HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. I also understood how servers process client requests, manage data, handle errors, and return appropriate HTTP status codes.

Additionally, I gained conceptual knowledge of how frontend and backend systems communicate using APIs. I studied how HTTP requests are sent from the frontend (using tools like Axios or Fetch), how JSON is used for data exchange, and how CORS enables cross-origin communication. This helped me understand the complete client-server workflow and the importance of structured API design for scalable web applications.
