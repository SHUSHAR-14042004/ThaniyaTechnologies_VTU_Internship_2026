I implemented the complete User Management module for the project. Designed and developed RESTful APIs for user registration and login using Node.js and Express. Integrated the backend with the database and created a structured Users table schema. Implemented authentication logic with proper validation and error handling. Connected the frontend forms to backend APIs using Axios for seamless data flow. Tested all endpoints on localhost and validated responses using Postman. Resolved routing and dependency issues during debugging. Successfully ensured an end-to-end user flow from registration to login.
